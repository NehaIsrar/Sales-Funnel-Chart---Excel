# Sales-Funnel-Chart---Excel

Created a sales funnel chart in Excel to tell a story from the first call to the completed purchase and track the process using a pipeline.

What is a sales funnel?

Letâ€™s start with the most important thing. Sales Funnel has stages, and stages represent an activity.

At the top of the sales funnel, a customer goes to the store and window-shopping.
A given percentage of these people make a decision and step into the store. This is the next stage of the sales funnel graph.
Next, the customer looks around and checks a rack of shoes on clearance. If they find a perfect shoe, we are on the next stage of the funnel.
Finally, the customer brings the decision at the end of the funnel and completes the purchase. At this moment, we have reached the bottom stage.
